# jmp-to-r-addin
[Built during technical internship at SAS Institute, May 2017 - Sep 2017]

Interactive add-in builder using JMP Scripting Language that allows end JMP users to create custom JMP add-ins and interfaces that execute R functions without writing JSL or R code (see full documentation: https://community.jmp.com/t5/JMP-Add-Ins/The-JMP-to-R-Add-In-Builder/ta-p/43879).

Presented software demo at JMP Developers' Meeting and at SAS Intern Expo to multiple executives.
This add-in may be implemented as a feature in a future release of production-ready software, such as JMP 15.
