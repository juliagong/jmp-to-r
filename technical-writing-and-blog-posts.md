JMP to R Add-In Builder: https://community.jmp.com/t5/JMP-Add-Ins/The-JMP-to-R-Add-In-Builder/ta-p/43879

JMP users may want to extend JMP's capabilities by accessing R functionalities. To make R functions more accessible to users without leaving the JMP platform, I created this guided configuration user interface that allows users to define and use custom JMP add-ins that execute R functions.
This add-in allows end users to analyze their data in JMP using R functions without writing JSL or R code. I presented this to the JMP Development team, including to the Co-Founder and Chief Executive of SAS.

I created a JMP add-in that allows users to define and use custom JMP add-ins that execute R functions without writing any JSL. The end user also does not need to write any R code. For more detailed information on the add-in, see the above documentation and jmp-to-r-addin repository.


Best Student Poster at JMP Discovery Summit: Using JMP Image Analysis Capabilities to Extract Skin Lesion Characteristics (https://community.jmp.com/t5/Discovery-Summit-2016/Using-JMP-Image-Analysis-Capabilities-to-Extract-Skin-Lesion/ta-p/23943, also see skin-cancer-analyzer repository)

Selected as the Best Student Poster for JMP Discovery Summit 2016.
The objective of this project is to use image analysis in JMP to develop an automated program for extracting metrics from skin lesion images. This poster discusses two main aspects of image analysis: feature extraction (image processing) and data extraction (analysis of those features to create metrics).


Technical Blog Post: Display Box 101 (https://community.jmp.com/t5/JMPer-Cable/Display-Box-Construction-101/ba-p/42226)

Navigating the display boxes in JMP Scripting Language can be tricky for first-time users, especially since tutorials and examples are not always well-documented. To address this issue, I wrote this technical blog post regarding building interactive user interfaces in JMP Scripting Language using display boxes, whether for a custom add-in, an interactive display for data, or a custom report.


Technical Blog Post: How to automate the creation of a JMP Add-In using JSL (https://community.jmp.com/t5/JMPer-Cable/How-to-automate-the-creation-of-a-JMP-Add-In-using-JSL/ba-p/43964)

Through this technical blog post, I give a tutorial on how to automate JMP add-in creation in JMP Scripting Language.
This prevents users from needing to manually generate add-ins of the same format multiple times.


Technical Blog Post: How to create a JMP user interface using display boxes in JSL (https://community.jmp.com/t5/JMPer-Cable/How-to-create-a-JMP-user-interface-using-display-boxes-in-JSL/ba-p/44034)

Using display box commands to create a custom user interface (UI) can be challenging for new JMP scripters, so I wrote a blog post by putting together a series of examples that have the main components of a JMP interface you might want to create. This tutorial will show the user the basic building blocks of creating interactive user interfaces in JMP using JMP Scripting Language.


Technical Blog Post: Getting started with the JMP to R Interface (https://community.jmp.com/t5/JMPer-Cable/Getting-started-with-the-JMP-to-R-Interface/ba-p/43920)

I worked a lot with the JMP to R interface when building my JMP add-in, the JMP to R Custom Add-In Builder. This blog
post teaches the reader how to get started with the JMP to R connection using JMP Scripting Language.


Banner-fying Images: A Script (https://community.jmp.com/t5/JMP-Blog/Banner-fying-your-images/ba-p/30744)

Aiming to make a custom LinkedIn banner that combined multiple pictures to illustrate my multiple interests, I wrote a short segment of JMP code that can blend two images of any size (though images in landscape work best), forming a
picture with the correct LinkedIn banner height-to-width ratio.


Technical Blog Post: 13 helpful (and lucky) JMP scripting tips (https://community.jmp.com/t5/JMP-Blog/13-helpful-and-lucky-JMP-scripting-tips/ba-p/30748)

Syntax got your tongue? To help JMP users with navigating JMP Scripting Language syntax, in this technical blog post, I
compiled 13 JMP Scripting Language tips that I found handy while learning JSL syntax.
